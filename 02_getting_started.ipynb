    "Python's `for` statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a `list` or a `string`), in the order that they appear in the sequence. The above function declares a list called `words` with three items: cat, widow, and defenestrate (all strings). Then, it says `for w` (used as an index here) in the list `words` `print` `w` (the item at that position and the length of that particular item). This is why we get the sequence of words with their string length returned. Upon completion of the `for` loop (when the loop has iterated over each item in the list) the loop terminates."
